### Built with

- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to use javaScript to make an accordion menu

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
openMenuBtn.addEventListener("click", ()=> {
    navUl.style.left = 50 + "%"
    navUl.style.opacity = 1
    openMenuBtn.classList.add("active")
    closeMenuBtn.classList.remove("active")
})
```

### Continued development

In my future projects I'd love to make use of javascript to customize most of the jobs that is to be done with css.
